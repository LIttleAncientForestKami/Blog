All ways lead to Rome
=====================

The other day I learned about pretotyping and decided that all ways lead to Rome.

So, what is Rome?
-----------------
It's actually having a good product. Building the right thing. What's wanted, required, beneficial to users.


Everything goes to "Rome".
--------------------------

1. **Agile** wants to *involve users* to make sure it's what they want.
2. **Formal contracts** are to specify it till the point all doubts are cleared away.
3. **Pretotyping** is about "*building the right IT before building IT right*".
4. **Requirements engineering** is about making sure what's required is there.
5. **Acceptance tests** (and **tests** in general) are to make sure you build it as you were supposed to.
6. **DDD** is about *ubiquitous language*, so that you and client talk about same things with same words, understand each other and thus build what's needed and what client wanted.
7. **Prototyping** is as pretotyping, just with more features and more likely to be a viable product.
8. And speaking of viable products... **MVP** of course, of lean "franchise".

I wonder now...
---------------
All those ways to reach the same goal and yet so often we get lost somewhere along them.
