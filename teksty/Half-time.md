Half-time
=========
1st June 2013

I started this blog as a year-long experiment - [see here](Time_to_start.md).

Now it's half-time - time to sum it up.

Objectives
----------

I wanted to try blogging - achieved, though not enough to say if it's worth it or not.
I wanted a place to post my findings. That's done and it works. It works well enough, that I put this blog under source control in case I lose it.

I also wanted to popularize few folks I believe deserve to be popularized. Optional target and heck, I don't know if I'll suceed here. :-) This requires my blog becomes popular, now doesn't it? :-) 

Final target was to learn about WordPress and it's workings: themes, widgets, APIs. Perhaps even to tweak the site myself. Now... the latter won't happen unless I migrate and I won't migrate this year. First I wanna know if I will keep blogging. 

But if I will... then I will migrate. Just staying on WP.com has advantages to start easy, but heck, I've hit the ceiling quite soon. 
1. Posting code.
2. Book I've read - only if I log to GoodYear? Why should I?
3. Plugins / widgets limitations.
4. Impossibility to tweak things as I want.

Not to mention the ads. :/ 

I learned few nice things anyway.

So far
-----
It's been worth it. Thanks to those who contributed to me blogging, those who read my posts and those who liked them. :-) And - obviously - to Wordpress crew!
