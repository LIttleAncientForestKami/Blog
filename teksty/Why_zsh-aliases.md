Why zsh - aliases
=================

I am evaluating zsh. Must say - like it so far.

My newest reason to is aliasing.

Pretty much every article on zsh worth it's salt will tell you about global aliases, right? The aliases that can be usable in lots of different places you more than once WANTED to use an alias yet couldn't.

It's good, it really is. But it ain't over with it. There is more! Namely: suffix aliases.

Suffix aliases are for given suffix, obviously. So, aliasing htm with firefox makes sure that firefox is what opens it. Trivial? Yeah, but I like it shorter. I like NOT having to type command name. I like not having to think whether it's that open command or another.
