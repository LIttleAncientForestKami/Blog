Good architecture… how do you know?
===================================

Just yesterday I gave a presentation at GigaCon DevCon in Wrocław, an abridged version of my talk from this year's 4Developers conference. Short note, how it went and what was it about. Along with links to slides.

Since I only had 30 minutes I knew I have to leave some things out. I decided to leave out:

1. Why you should measure - most of it anyway
2. Scenario methods - they are complex enough on their own and deserve their own time. Also, group methods require some mentions of how to organize them. For same reason I left out NPS, I just mentioned what all of these are about.
