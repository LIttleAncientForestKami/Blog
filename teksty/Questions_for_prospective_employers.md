January 19, 2013

**Money**

1. Salary range?
2. Which day of the month do salaries get transferred?

**General**

1. Office hours are?
 *  Overtime – how much, how often, how it’s paid?
 *  Do you practice flexible hours?
2. Dress code? Business-casual, suits and ties,  nobody cares? T-shirts/shorts/sandals?
3. Is there a shower in the office?

**Commuting**

I do that by car or by bicycle. I would like to know where the office is located and:

1. Will I get parking spots?
2. Work from home is allowed? If commuting will be very lengthy I’ll be interested in working in the office only for a few days, instead of full week.

**Work**

1. What hardware will I get to work on it? Can I ask for something more and get it?
2. Do you enforce MS Windows or some IDE or some other OS/ technology / tool to be used while working?
3. What kind of production and development environment you guys have?
  *  Java version?
  *  Frameworks, servers, libraries?
  *  Other dominant technologies (Clojure, JS, CFML, SQL standard and DB)?

**Quality**

1.  How long does a build last?
1.  How good test coverage is in my (in spe) project?
1.  Do you use a CI sever? Sonar?
1.  Code reviews? Pair-programming? Allowed, enforced, frowned upon?
1.  Version control system?

**Other**

1.   What are training prospects?
1. *      Do you have a wiki? A library? Conduct internal trainings? Send people to trainings? Have a conference budget?
1.   Will I be able to influence project-related decisions? How?
1.   How empowered is my team?
1. *      If we are asked to do something we find utterly silly, are we expected to say no or are we expected to deliver as true professionals?
1. *      Who gives us orders?
1. *      Who are our clients?

Thank you.
