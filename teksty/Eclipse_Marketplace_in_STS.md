Eclipse marketplace in STS
==========================
January 5, 2013

Turn off from Eclipse: loading time (and few others).
STS has a nice and short load time (compared).

But I found out I can’t seem to find Eclipse Marketplace which I liked, as it’s one of the most prominent ways to install plugins to Eclipse. Since that makes life easier to have such place to look for tools if I need them, I searched STS and…

And I wanted colors. [Just as Bartosz did.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/120621/dark-color-scheme-for-eclipse)

So, I searched and found, that if you want to have Eclipse MarketPlace in STS, you need to install the extension to have it.

**Dashboard** > **Extensions** > **Eclipse MarketPlace** > there you go
