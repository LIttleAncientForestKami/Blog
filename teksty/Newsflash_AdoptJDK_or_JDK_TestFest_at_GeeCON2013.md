Newsflash: Adopt JDK or JDK Test Fest at GeeCON 2013
=====================
April 24, 2013

I jumped at opportunity to help [GeeCON Team](http://2013.geecon.org/about) and am now co-organizing a very nice event – JDK Test Fest, or, as some know it – Adopt JDK.

Thanks to [Steve Poole](http://2013.geecon.org/speakers/steve-poole) and [Richard Warburton](http://2013.geecon.org/speakers/richard-warburton), this May in Kraków we will have unique opportunity to cover JDK with tests.

More details will soon follow.
