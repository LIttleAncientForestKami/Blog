Time to start
=============
December 31, 2012

It’s ending time, so time to start something new. A year-long experiment.
What I want?
-----------
1.    Try blogging. :-P
2.    Place to post things I discover and re-discover (after, of course, forgetting them :-P ).
3.    Popularize few folks I know and like. (optional target)
4.    Get to know WordPress (nice to have) – themes, widgets, etc. Or, simply tweak this site myself.
