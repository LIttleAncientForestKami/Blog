About
=====

Storage for my blog at http://lafkblogs.wordpress.com

If I decide to move, my texts won't be lost. Also, starting from June 2013, this is where my texts land before they go to WP.

Future
------
I may automate this. I may think of a way to add images nicely here. 

Older texts order
=================
Older texts were added May/June and their date don't reflect the real order.
